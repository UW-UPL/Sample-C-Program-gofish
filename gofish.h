/**
 * The below C macros are called header guards. It prevents the
 * following content from being expanded more than once in a
 * given source file. For example, if you include this header
 * in a source file and you also include another header that
 * includes this header, it will be included twice, therefore
 * you will end up with more than one declaration of everything
 * that is defined here. This header guard works as follows:
 *
 * 
 * 1) _GOFISH_H_ is undefined.
 * 2) The c preprocessor starts processing your source file 
 *        and encounters: #include "gofish.h"
 * 3) The c preprocessor starts expanding gofish.h into your
 *        source file and encounters: #ifdef _GOFISH_H_
 * 4) Is _GOFISH_H_ defined? NO
 * 5) The c preprocessor encounters: define _GOFISH_H_ and
 *        now _GOFISH_H_ is defined (with no value).
 * 6) The rest of the gofish.h header is expanded into the
 *        source file
 *
 * Now suppose in your source file, you include file.h, which
 * also includes this header.
 *
 * 7) The c preprocessor encounters: "#include <file.h>"
 * 8) The c preprocessor starts expanding file.h and
 *           encounters: #include "gofish.h"
 * 9) Now, the c preprocessor starts expanding gofish.h for a second 
 *           time and encounters: #ifndef _GOFISH_H_
 * 10) Is _GOFISH_H_ defined? YES - we have already processes gofish.h
 *
 * Final notes:
 *
 * Macro expansion works on a per source file basis. This means that
 * each source file starts with a clean slate of macros. When the
 * c preprocessor works on each individual file, each file will
 * get an expansion of the header gofish.h.
