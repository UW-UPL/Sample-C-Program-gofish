/**
 * It is a human's turn. This function is complicated so it has
 * been heavily commented.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   p: The player who is going now.
 *   guess_rank: The rank that is guessed.
 *   guess_player: The player who we are asking.
 *
 *
 * The double pointer for player may seem complicated. Basically,
 * the game is asking us for a pointer to a player to ask. Therefore,
 * The game has provided us with a pointer to a location where we can
 * store the value of the player we will ask:
 *
 *                  +---------+
 *                  | Game    |
 *                  |         |
 *            +---->| rank:4  |
 *            | +-->| player: |--+
 *            | |   +---------+  |
 *            | |                |
 * +--------+ | |                |   +----------+
 * | HPT    | | |                +-->|Player    |
 * |        | | |                    |          |
 * | rank   |-+ |                    |name: bill|
 * | player |---+                    |cards: ...|
 * +--------+                        +----------+
 *
 *
 * You can see that the value player in Game points to the player
 * bill. We are given a pointer to a pointer to a player in 
 * human_player_turn. We will fill this pointer with a pointer
 * to the player bill. This is how it ends up being a double
 * pointer.
