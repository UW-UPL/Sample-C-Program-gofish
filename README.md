# Go Fish

This game is provided free and open source by the UW-Madison Undergraduate 
Projects Laboratory (UPL). It is intended to be a decently simple sample C program.

## How to Play

To compile the game, you will need a C compiler and a Linux environment.
If you are running on the CSL machines, all you need to do is:

```
make all
./gofish
```

And you're ready to play!
