## Still needs to get done

 - Check after each turn to see if the game is over
 - At the start of the game, see if anyone acquired a full set (rare)
 - Only allow players to guess cards that they have in their hand.
 - Don't allow a player to guess if they have no cards
 - Add more general programming comments
